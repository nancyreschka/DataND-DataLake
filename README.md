# Data Lake

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Datasets

The two datasets that we are working on reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

```
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
```

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

### Fact Table
#### songplays
Records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong.
```
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

```

### Dimension Tables
#### users
Users in the app.
```
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

```

#### songs
Songs in music database.
```
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

```

#### artists
Artists in music database.
```
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

```

#### time
Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units.
```
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

```

## ETL pipeline

The data is loaded from the S3 bucket (json-files) into Spark dataframes.

The data is transformed in the Spark dataframe and the necessary data for each analytic table is extracted and finally stored into parquet file in a S3 bucket on AWS.
The log_data is also filtered by page = 'NextSong' and it is made sure no NULL values are inserted in the analytic tables.

## Steps to launch the ETL pipeline

### 1 Configuration file adaption

To be able to access S3 AWS credentials are nedded. To store the analytical tables the S3 destination is needed. Make sure to adapt the parameters in dl.cfg.

### 2 Executing the ETL pipeline

Next step is to run the ETL. The file execution.ipynb can be used to run the ETL.

The data is processed in the following way:
Loads data from S3 into Spark dataframe -> convert/extract data for analytic tables (fact and dimension tables) -> store data in parquet files in S3
